## /surveys/new

Can't seem to create choices.  I can create questions, but I can't create
choices.

## /surveys

I would think that this route should exist

## Function

Overall the core proposition of the app doesn't seem to work.  I can't create
multiple choices for a survey.  Am I missing out on how I'm supposed to do
this?

The views are nice and the internal code is clean if not occasionally
over-engineered.  I think some of the methods are clearly quite over-large or
maybe kind of brittle and I've called them out.
